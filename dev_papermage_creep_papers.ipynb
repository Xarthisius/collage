A collection of recent data from the literature on Ti-6Al-4V produced by\\nconventional technologies and heat treated to produce different microstructures was analysed to determine the effect of the microstructure on the creep behaviour of this material. A unique constitutive equation derived from\\na model developed for face-centred cubic (fcc) metals was successfully used to describe the creep response, irrespective of the different microstructures. The same constitutive model was able to provide an excellent\\ndescription of the minimum creep rate dependence on the applied stress for the alloy produced by additive manufacturing, notwithstanding the obvious differences in the microstructures. These observations led to the\\nreconsideration of some consolidated opinions on the behaviour of Ti-6Al-4V, shedding light on the substantial similarities in the creep responses when the microstructure has different morphologies. The initial microstruc-\\ntural features, which have traditionally been thought to greatly influence the creep response, indeed played an important role because they determined the magnitude of the ultimate tensile strength, but this effect gradually\\ndisappeared at high temperatures and low stresses.\\n1. Introduction\\nTi-6Al-4V is a titanium alloy that is the most widely used metallic\\nmaterial in additive manufacturing. Titanium is an allotropic element\\nthat exists with two different crystal structures: the α -Ti phase, which\\nhas a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline arrangement and is stable\\nbelow 995 ◦ C, and the β -Ti phase, which is a body-centred cubic (bcc)\\nstructure and is stable above 995 ◦ C ( β -transus temperature). Alloying\\nelements play a key role in defining the β -Ti transus temperature and\\nhave a direct impact on the alloy microstructure and its evolution during\\nmanufacturing processes and post-processing. Aluminium, in particular,\\nis an α -Ti stabiliser, whereas vanadium is a β -Ti phase stabiliser. The α - β\\nphase transformation in Ti-6Al-4V strongly depends on the temperature\\nhistory and cooling rates typical of the fabrication process used. Thus,\\nequiaxed, Widmanst ¨ atten, or duplex microstructures can be obtained by\\nan appropriate combination of thermomechanical processing and heat\\ntreatments.\\nThe equiaxed microstructure consists of α -grains surrounded by a far\\nlower volume fraction of finer β -grains. Colonies of α -lamellae,\\nseparated by a low fraction of retained β phase, enriched in vanadium,\\nform under lower cooling rates. At higher cooling rates, a finer Wid-\\nmanst ¨ atten structure (frequently defined as ‘basket-weave ’ ) appears.\\nThe duplex microstructure consists of both α -equiaxed grains and grains\\nwith a basket-weave structure.\\nThe nature and morphology of the microstructure are known to\\nprofoundly affect the mechanical properties of alloys [1 – 3]. In this re-\\ngard, the importance of the previous thermal history is magnified in the\\ncase of additively manufactured alloys [4]. Because powder bed fusion\\nentails cooling rates as fast as 10 6 ◦ C/s, the complete α - β phase transition\\ncannot occur, and upon fast cooling from above the β -transus temper-\\nature, the bcc phase decomposes as a result of a martensitic (diffusion-\\nless) transformation, giving rise to the formation of α martensite in the\\nas-built condition. This α ′ - martensite, which is characterised by a high\\ndislocation density, assumes the morphology of fine needles. The size of\\nthe martensitic needles, together with the orientation of prior β -grains\\n(responsible for the typical as-built anisotropy), should strongly affect\\nthe mechanical properties of the fabricated part.\\nThe prevalent martensitic α ′ microstructure of additively\\n* Corresponding author.

Post-processing heat treatments increase the ductility at the\\nexpense of strength, breaking through the strength-ductility trade-off\\ndilemma. Studies on the heat treatments of additively manufactured Ti-\\n6Al-4V have shown that heating temperatures below 700 ◦ C in an Ar\\natmosphere for 2 – 3 h (typical conditions of stress relief) are insufficient\\nto fully decompose the martensitic phase. The same applies to short heat\\ntreatments (2 h) performed below 500 ◦ C. However, when the heating\\ntemperature is increased to 800 ◦ C, for times as long as 6 h, the complete\\ndecomposition of the martensite is achieved, together with an increase\\nin ductility. All these microstructural changes profoundly affect the final\\nproperties; therefore, they have been the subject of a number of different\\nstudies [4 – 8].\\nAs in the case of materials produced by traditional technologies, the\\nfinal microstructure not only affects the room temperature properties,\\nbut also it is thought to strongly influence the creep response [9 – 11].\\nThese preliminary studies indicated that additive manufacturing resul-\\nted in an increase in the creep strength. However, extensive evidence on\\nthe subject is still lacking, because the available data do not cover a\\nsufficiently broad range of experimental conditions to obtain, for\\nexample, constitutive equations that reliably describe the material\\nresponse. In particular, the dependence of the most widely used\\nparameter to express the creep properties (i.e. the minimum creep rate)\\non the experimental conditions (stress and temperature) has not been\\ninvestigated in detail. The traditional approach for describing the min-\\nimum creep rate ( ˙ ε m ) dependence on the applied stress ( σ ) and absolute\\ntemperature ( T ) is based on the Mukherjee-Bird-Dorn equation, here\\npresented in the form:\\n˙ ε m = ADGbkT ( σ G ) n\\n(1)\\nwhere b is the Burgers vector, G is the shear modulus, k is Boltzmann ’ s\\nconstant, n is the stress exponent, A is a dimensionless constant, and\\nD = D 0 exp\\n(\\n(cid:0) Q L RT\\n)\\n(2)\\nwhere D 0 is a material parameter, and Q L is the activation energy (for\\nlattice self-diffusion in pure metals). Eq. (1) is extensively used for pure\\nmetals and simple alloys, but it requires a series of modifications to\\ndescribe more complex materials such as Ti-6Al-4V.\\nThis study originated from the observation that several aspects of the\\ncreep response of Ti-6Al-4V produced by additive manufacturing (AM)\\nstill require further investigation. This goal, on the other hand, cannot\\nbe effectively pursued without clarifying in detail the creep mechanisms\\noperating in Ti-6Al-4V produced by traditional technologies.\\n2. Experimental procedures\\nTi-6Al-4V ELI (Extra Low Interstitials) powders (5.5 – 6.5% Al,\\n3.5 – 4.5% V, 0.25% Fe, < 0.1% O, < 0.05% N, < 0.08% C, < 0.011% H, Ti\\nbal, wt%) were used with selective laser melting (SLM) to produce flat\\ndog-bone creep samples with the geometry shown in Fig. 1. The building\\ndirection was parallel to the gauge length of the specimen.\\nAn SLM280 machine, equipped with a 400 W IPG fibre laser, pro-\\nduced all the samples. The samples were built along the Z-axis with a\\nlayer thickness (t) of 60 µ m, scanning speed (v) of 1250 mm/s, hatch\\nspacing (h) of 120 µ m, and laser power (P) of 340 W.\\nThermal treatment at 740 ◦ C for 130 min in a vacuum furnace was\\nfollowed by cooling to room temperature with argon gas for 1 h. The\\nannealing temperature was chosen as a compromise aimed at obtaining\\nsufficiently high mechanical properties (UTS = 1000 – 1100 MPa) and\\nacceptable ductility. Appendix 1 shows the variation of UTS as a func-\\ntion of annealing time and duration, the annealing conditions here\\nanalysed roughly corresponding to the inflection point of the plot.\\nTensile tests at room temperature were carried out on a set of creep\\nsamples with the surface in the as-deposited state to evaluate the ulti-\\nmate tensile strength (UTS). The testing strain rate was 3 × 10 (cid:0) 2 s (cid:0) 1 .\\nConstant load and variable load experiments (CLEs and VLEs,\\nrespectively) were carried out in air. In the CLEs, the sample was tested\\nunder the same load, P , until it reached the tertiary region. In most cases,\\nthe test was interrupted before fracture. In the VLEs, the load increased\\nafter the sample attained a well-defined minimum creep rate range. For\\nall the investigated conditions, the nominal stress σ = P / A 0 , where A 0 is\\nthe initial area of the gauge transversal section, will be considered in the\\nfollowing. This choice was justified by the intent of comparing the creep\\ndata obtained in the present study with the data from previous studies\\nfound in the literature, which usually report the creep rate as a function\\nof the nominal stress. In any case, this simplification does not signifi-\\ncantly impair the accuracy of the description because the minimum\\ncreep rate was observed for low strains.\\nTo maintain a homogeneous heating profile in the furnace, the test\\ntemperature was measured using four thermocouples. Elongation was\\ncontinuously measured using an LVDT.\\nSamples for light microscopy were mechanically ground and pol-\\nished with a colloidal suspension; Kroll ’ s reagent (100 mL H2O + 2 mL\\nHF + 4 mL HNO3) was used to etch the polished surfaces.

Fig. 5a illustrates the minimum creep\\nrate as a function of the nominal stress (the true stress was very similar,\\nbecause the minimum creep rate was observed at relatively low strains).\\nThe slope of the curve at 500 ◦ C in Fig. 5a increases with stress from 4.5\\nup to 20, while at 650 ◦ C the experimental data substantially align on a\\nstraight line with a slope close to 3.6.

The microstructure of VLE500, after 476 h at high tem-\\nperature, still showed a noticeable amount of α ′ -martensite within the α\\n- phase. The volume fraction of α -grains containing α ′ - martensite col-\\nonies had a range of 25 – 28%, but these grains were not entirely\\ncomposed of martensite, so the total amount of α ′ -martensite was far\\nlower. This fine acicular α ′ -martensite nucleated at the prior β grain\\nboundaries (PBGB), from which it grew within the forming α - grains\\nduring fast cooling from SLM. The α ’ - colonies mostly formed a chess-\\nboard structure. Inside this chessboard structure, small colonies evolved\\nas aligned fine α ′ -martensite lamellae. These were observed to bear a\\nwell-given crystallographic variant orientation relationship to the\\nhosting α -phase, which typically resulted in an orientation deviation of\\napproximately ± 45 ◦ with respect to α (both α and α ’ have the same hcp\\ncrystallographic structure with minimal lattice differences). The above-\\nmentioned crystallographic orientation deviation between the α and α ’\\nconstituents is clearly shown by the selected area diffraction pattern\\n(SAEDP) reported in Fig. 6, where representative TEM micrographs of\\nthe 500/160, 600/100, and 650/100 sample microstructures after creep\\nrupture are reported.\\nThe α ′ -phase exhibited the expected high density of tangled dislo-\\ncations, responsible for the process of martensite strain accommodation,\\nas shown in Fig. 6a. In addition, several of the mutually parallel fine α ′ - martensite colonies were internally twinned (see the SAEDP inlet on\\nthe bottom left-hand side of Fig. 6a). These were formed to a much finer\\nscale, tens of nanometres in width.\\nSmall amounts of the β -phase were also detected. This phase exhibits\\na platelet morphology with a typical aspect ratio greater than four and is\\nmainly located at the PBGB.\\nThe material crept under a lower load ( σ = 100 MPa) and higher\\ntemperatures (600 and 650 ◦ C) did not reveal the presence of α ′ -martensite colonies within the α -phase, while a small fraction of the β\\nphase could be detected (Fig. 6a – c). The amount of β -phase was slightly\\nlower in the VLE500 specimen ( ≅ 3%) than in the CLE600 and CLE650\\ncrept samples, with β -phase volume fractions ranging between 4% and\\n8%. Volume fraction of β , α , and α + α ′ are listed in Table 3. These values\\nwere very close to the volume fraction after heat treatment; therefore, it\\ncould reasonably be concluded that creep exposure did not cause sig-\\nnificant variations in the β -phase amounts. The β platelets had a typical\\nlateral width (thickness) of a few nanometres, with an average value of\\n20 ± 4 nm, irrespective of the creep condition. The crystallographic\\nrelationship between the β - phase platelets and the surrounding α - and α ’ - phases (whenever the latter was formed) was as follows: [111] β ||\\n[11 – 20] α , [111] β || [ (cid:0) 12 – 13] α , and [011] β || [0001] α ’ . The lattice pa-\\nrameters for the α - and martensitic α ′ - phases were a = 2.94 and\\nc = 4.67 Å. The lattice parameter of the bcc β -phase was a = 3.19 Å.\\nSAEDP revealed that the typical orientation relationship between β and α ’ had the (10 (cid:0) 10) α ’ || (01 (cid:0) 1) β directions and [1 – 10] α ’ || [111] β plane\\nzone axis (see also [21]).\\nThe transformation from β to α ’ , within the forming α -phase during\\nfast cooling, essentially occurred as a result of short-range atomic\\ndisplacement. The minimal necessary displacement distance could be\\nevaluated as the linear difference between the interplanar spacing of the\\n(01 (cid:0) 10) α and (110) β crystallographic directions [22 – 24]. In this regard,\\ntwo variants of the α ’ - martensite crystallographic directions at the PBGB\\nwere observed, as shown in Fig. 6d. The reported SADP inset of Fig. 6d\\nactually consists of two patterns of the [ (cid:0) 12 – 13] α ’ zone axis, which are\\nrelated by a rotation of 180 ◦ about the normal to the (31 (cid:0) 4 (cid:0) 1) α ’ plane.\\nThe projected trace of this plane was parallel to the projected trace of the\\ninterface across two adjacent α ’ -platelets. Hence, the two adjacent\\nmartensite colonies were twin-related with the interface plane corre-\\nsponding to the ( (cid:0) 3 to 141) α and (31 (cid:0) 4 (cid:0) 1) α ’ twinning planes, in\\nagreement with the findings of Dumas et al. [25]. Moreover, the crys-\\ntallographic relationships between β and α ’ and between β and α were in\\ngood agreement with some previous studies on SLM Ti-6Al-4V [13,\\n26 – 31].\\nWhenever formed, deformation twins nucleated at α -to- α ’ interfaces\\nbecause of the local stress – strain concentration associated with accu-\\nmulating dislocations and, to some extent, dislocation misfit [32,33]. It\\nis believed that the formation of twins within the α ’ -colonies mostly\\noccurred at the α -to- β interfaces. This was due to the different crystal-\\nlographic structures of the α and β phases, which could, in principle,\\nresult in different plastic deformation responses during the creep test.\\nThe ease of ledge formation within the α ’ -colonies and at the α -to- β\\ninterfaces was likely to lead to a stress concentration under external\\nloading (i.e. creep). Therefore, twin nucleation was favoured through\\nthe nucleation and emission of dislocations within the α ’ colonies, as\\nwell as at the α -to- β interface locations.\\n3.4. Hardness after creep\\nThe hardness was measured in a region that experienced only ageing,\\nwithout any substantial effect of an external load, that is, on the heads of\\nthe crept samples. Fig. 7 shows the hardness values as a function of the\\nexposure time. This figure reveals that even prolonged holding at high\\ntemperatures did not produce dramatic variations in hardness. The\\nmoderate difference in HV could be attributed to the progressive\\ntransformation of martensite during high-temperature exposure. A\\nmoderate decrease to 350 HV, corresponding to a UTS of 970 MPa based\\non Eq. (3), was only observed for the longest experiments at 650 ◦ C.\\n4. Discussion\\nThe correct understanding of the creep mechanisms acting in a given\\nmaterial, subjected to a given load at high temperature, is of paramount\\nimportance for a proper design of the component. This is particularly the\\ncase of AM-produced parts, whose microstructure is peculiar. The usual\\napproach consists in investigating a specific set of samples, obtaining\\nconstitutive relationships correlating creep rate, stress and temperature.\\nThe obvious problem is that this description will fit only that specific set,\\nmaking the comparison with other sets obtained under different con-\\nditions quite problematic. This section thus represents an effort to frame\\nthe problem of the creep response of a Ti-6Al-4V obtained by SLM in a\\nTable 3 Volume fraction of β , α , and α + α ′ in VLE500, CLE600, and CLE650.\\ncreep sample\\nβ , % vol.\\nα + α ’ , % vol.\\nα , % vol.\\nVLE500\\n~3\\n26.5 ± 1.5\\nbal.

The final -and indeed somewhat ambitious- aim is to\\nidentify a generalized model, appropriated for all the initial states,\\nirrespective of the production technology.\\nThe previous section demonstrated that the creep behaviour of the\\nTi-6Al-4V produced by AM was purely conventional, that is, its mini-\\nmum creep rate dependence on stress and temperature, when analysed\\nby the conventional phenomenological models, suggests that creep is\\nclimb-controlled. However, in order to discuss any peculiarities of the\\ncreep response of the Ti-6Al-4V produced by AM, it is necessary to\\nproperly address the analysis of the behaviour of the alloy produced by\\ntraditional technologies. This, in turn, requires a preliminary interpre-\\ntation of the creep response of pure α -Ti.\\nFig. 8. a) Minimum creep rate as a function of stress for: pure Ti [34,35] and model curves with A = 40, UTS = 500 MPa, D 0 = 1.7 × 10 (cid:0) 8 m 2 s (cid:0) 1 and Q\\nL = 193 kJ mol (cid:0) 1 . b) The combined BW dataset [44,45] and model curves with UTS = 930 MPa [46]. c) The combined RRBB dataset [47 – 50], data from [46] (N), [51] (A), [52] (L) and model curves with UTS = 905 MPa [46]. d) The combined AOS dataset [53 – 55], data from [46] (N), [56] (B) and model curves with UTS\\n= 930 MPa [46].

The experimental data were analysed\\nusing a modified form of Eq. (1):\\n˙ ε m = AD 0 Gb kT ( σ ρ G ) 3 exp ( σ ρ b 3 kT ) exp\\n{\\n(cid:0) Q L RT\\n[\\n1 (cid:0)\\n( σ ρ\\nR max\\n) 2 ]}\\n(4)\\nwhere\\nσ ρ = σ (cid:0) σ i ≅ σ\\n(5)\\nThe internal stress, σ i , represents the strength of the pure annealed\\nlarge-grained metal, that is, the stress required to move a dislocation in\\nthe absence of other dislocations. The R max parameter (maximum\\nstrength) was tentatively obtained as follows [36,37]:\\nR max = 1 . 5 UTS G T G RT ,\\n(6)\\nwhere G RT and G T are the shear moduli at room temperature and at\\ntesting T , respectively. The formulation of Eq. (4) is similar to that used\\nin the description of pure fcc metals [38 – 40] and contains additional\\nterms compared with Eq. (1). This equation was derived on the\\nassumption of a balance between work hardening and recovery, and was\\nbased on the combination of the climb mobility of dislocations, as given\\nby Hirth and Lothe [41]:\\nM climb = D 0 b kT exp\\n( σ b 3\\nkT\\n)\\nexp\\n(\\n(cid:0) Q RT\\n)\\n(7)\\nand the glide mobility, as expressed by Kocks et al. [42]:\\nM glide ∝ exp\\n{\\n(cid:0) Q RT\\n[\\n1 (cid:0)\\n( σ\\nR max\\n) p ] q }\\n(8)\\nwith p = 2 and q = 1 [38,39]. The term for the glide mobility was\\noriginally introduced in the model because the climb mobility assumes\\nvery low values at room temperature and cannot account for the\\nobserved values of the experimental creep strain rates (for a more\\ndetailed discussion on this subject, readers are referred to [43]).\\nEq. (4) requires only the identification of the correct coefficient of\\ndiffusion, Eq. (2), and of the A constant. Table 2 lists the vacancy\\ndiffusivity values [20]. Because the materials investigated in [34] and\\n[35] did not correspond to high-purity Ti, it is possible to tentatively\\nassume D 0 = 1.0 × 10 – 8 m 2 s (cid:0) 1 and Q L = 197 kJ mol (cid:0) 1 . The material\\ntested in [35] had a yield strength of 350 MPa [57], and when tested in\\ncompression at 150 ◦ C-10 (cid:0) 3 s (cid:0) 1 , exhibited a maximum strength in\\nexcess of 700 MPa [57]; thus, an R max v alue of 850 MPa at room tem-\\nperature could be assumed. The curves presented in Fig. 8a were ob-\\ntained with A = 40 and R max = 850 MPa at 30 ◦ C. The correlation\\nbetween the data and the model curves is reasonably good if one takes\\ninto account that neglecting the internal stress term leads to a stress\\nexponent n = 3, versus an experimental value that was closer to 4. At the\\nlowest temperature, a slightly larger deviation between the model and\\ndata is observed, but the overall experimental trend, with a marked\\nincrease in the slope of the strain rate vs. stress data, is well described.\\nThe next step will be to determine the constitutive equations for\\ncreep in the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. As previously mentioned, this material can\\nexhibit different initial microstructures, that is, fully equiaxed, Wid-\\nmanstatten (fully lamellar, basket-weave), and duplex, although the\\ndominant constituent usually remains the hcp α -phase. Recent data were\\ncollected from the literature and are discussed in the following, starting\\nfrom the most complete datasets, those on duplex microstructures.\\n4.2. Constitutive analysis of Ti-6Al-4V with bimodal (duplex)\\nmicrostructure between 450 and 650 ◦ C\\nFig. 9b shows the creep data obtained by Badea et al. [44] and\\nWhittaker et al. [45] (see Table 4 for details). Although a significant\\nexperimental scatter is self-evident (see the tests repeated by Badea et al.\\nunder the same stress), the two datasets are fully consistent with each\\nother and substantially overlap, covering more than five orders of\\nmagnitude, which is a noticeable feature. The calculated values of the\\nactivation energy for creep ranged between 250 and 326 kJ mol (cid:0) 1 [44,\\n45].\\nThe first assumption made here is that the creep, in this intermediate\\nrange of temperature, is mainly controlled by dislocation activity in the α -phase, which was the predominant constituent, exactly as in pure Ti.\\nIn particular, it will be here supposed that creep is climb-controlled.\\nBecause most Al segregates in this phase, a solid solution hardening\\neffect could be expected. Thus, Eq. (5) can be modified as follows:\\nσ ρ = σ (cid:0) σ i (cid:0) σ ss (cid:0) σ p\\n(9)\\nwhere σ ss is the drag stress exerted by solute atoms on dislocations, and σ\\np is a possible particle strengthening term because of the interaction\\nbetween dislocations and secondary-phase precipitates such as Ti 3 Al.\\nHowever, because the TEM investigations in [44] did not reveal signif-\\nicant precipitation phenomena, the term σ p will be neglected here. On\\nthe other hand, drag stress has been shown in single-phase solid solu-\\ntions under a wide range of experimental conditions and is roughly\\nproportional to iving\\nFig. 9. a) Minimum creep rate as a function of the applied stress at 700 ◦ C for the combined RRBB dataset [47 – 50].

Let us thus assume\\nthat Q L = 303 kJ mol (cid:0) 1 and D 0 = 1.0 × 10 – 3 m 2 s (cid:0) 1 . Taking A = 40 as in\\npure Ti and UTS = 930 MPa [46] into Eq. (6), the model curves in\\nFig. 8b were obtained with δ = 0.4. The description is excellent, and the\\nvalue δ = 0.4 compares well with the estimated values of 0.29 for Al-2%\\nMg [36] and 0.37 for IN718 [60]. This directly leads to an obvious ob-\\njection: how can a complex commercial alloy behave like high-purity Ti,\\nwhile commercially pure Ti exhibits a different lattice diffusivity? A\\npossible answer lies in the observed differences in the diffusion coeffi-\\ncient. According to the models illustrated by Kanou et al. [61], impu-\\nrities, particularly Fe atoms, play a key role in accelerating\\nself-diffusion. Thus, as long as single-phase Ti is considered, the\\nhigher level of Fe in the low-purity material causes the observed strong\\nvariation in diffusivity. In the case of Ti-6Al-4V, a second phase, β , is\\npresent in small but noticeable amounts. Experimental evidence has\\ndemonstrated that Fe atoms tend to segregate in the β -phase [61]. If this\\nis true, one could reasonably conclude that because of this segregation,\\nthe residual amount of Fe in the α -phase is so low that the diffusivity of\\nthe alloy is substantially equivalent to that of high-purity Ti.\\n4.3. Constitutive analysis of Ti-6Al-4V with equiaxed microstructure\\nbetween 500 and 700 ◦ C\\nTable 5 summarises the selection of the most recently available\\nsources. These data were used in the present study to analyse the in-\\ntermediate temperature creep response of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy with an\\nequiaxed microstructure. The list is limited to investigations that\\nconsidered experiments at 700 ◦ C or below. Fig. 8c shows the minimum\\ncreep rate as a function of the applied stress obtained under a constant\\nload, as reported in [46 – 52]. The same research group, in particular,\\npublished four of these works [47 – 50]. For this reason, these data are\\nconsidered a unique set, identified by the RRBB acronym (from the\\ninitials of the surnames of the first authors of the relevant papers).\\nThe microstructure consists of equiaxed fine α -Ti grains with a low\\n(12% in [48]) volume fraction of much finer β -grains distributed along\\ngrain boundaries. The persistent predominance of one constituent sug-\\ngests that the assumption that creep, in this intermediate range of\\ntemperature, is mainly controlled by dislocation activity in the α -phase,\\nis still reasonable. Thus, the same equations (Eqs. (4) and (9)) can be\\nused with Eq. (6), again with A = 40, δ = 0.4, Q L = 303 kJ mol (cid:0) 1 , and\\nD 0 = 1.4 × 10 (cid:0) 3 m 2 s (cid:0) 1 , with UTS = 905 MPa [46]. The calculated\\nmodel curves presented in Fig. 8c provide an excellent description of the\\ndata at 500 ◦ C and of some of the results at 600 ◦ C, while a substantial\\ndeviation is observed in the low stress regimes at 600 ◦ C and 700 ◦ C.\\nThus, the model previously used for the alloy with a duplex structure\\nseemed to work quite well for the equiaxed alloy, except at the highest\\ntemperature/low stresses, which deserved a more detailed analysis,\\nwhich will be addressed in the next section.\\n4.4. Constitutive analysis of Ti-6Al-4V with Widmanstatten\\nmicrostructure between 500 and 600 ◦ C\\nThe last morphology typical of Ti-6Al-4V is the Widmanstatten\\nstructure. Table 6 summarises a collection of experimental data, and the\\ncorresponding minimum creep rate values are shown in Fig. 8d. This\\nfigure also shows that, in this case, a very large scatter characterises the\\nexperimental results. At 500 ◦ C under 291 – 300 MPa, for example, the\\ndata span more than two orders of magnitude. The available data thus\\nform a cloud rather than converging on a single curve, as in the duplex\\nmicrostructure. In particular, the dataset from [56] exhibits strain rates\\nthat are more than one order of magnitude lower than those reported in\\n[53,54]. This scatter can hardly be rationalised if one considers that the\\nexperimental data were obtained by testing similar materials if not the\\nsame alloy, and will be discussed later.\\nAs long as the volume fraction of the β -phase in the Widmanstatten\\nstructure is low (in [63], it was close to 17%), the assumption that creep\\nis controlled by the dislocation activity in the α -phase can be main-\\ntained. Thus, the same equations could be used, with the relevant value\\nof the room-temperature tensile strength in Eq. (6). The tensile strength\\nof the Widmanstatten alloy in [46] was roughly equivalent to that re-\\nported in the same source for duplex Til-5Al-4V. Thus, a value of ≅ 930 MPa for the UTS could be used, which obviously leads to a\\ncoincidence of the curves for the minimum creep rate dependence on the\\napplied stress for the duplex and Widmanstatten microstructures. The\\naccuracy of the description is tolerable, although the strain rate at\\n500 ◦ C seems to be somewhat overestimated.\\n4.5. Effect of microstructure on creep response of Ti-6Al-4V:\\nreconsidering consolidated opinions\\nThe previous paragraphs seem to suggest that the same set of\\nconstitutive equations can effectively describe the creep response irre-\\nspective of the starting microstructure, although in the case of the\\nWidmanstatten structure, the dispersion of the available data precludes\\na definitive conclusion on the subject. If the same equations describe all\\nthe microstructures, one can legitimately wonder whether the\\nmorphology and distribution of the different phases have a real major\\neffect on the creep response. On the other hand, in specific cases, a\\nsignificant deviation between the model description and experimental\\nTable 5 Details of the alloy with equiaxed microstructure (the last column reports the\\nacronyms used in the Figures).\\nthermomechanical treatment\\nquantitative notes on microstructure ( α -grains)\\nsource\\nacronym\\n950 ◦ C/6 h + a.c.\\n9 µ m α -grains\\n[46]\\nN hot forging + 190 ◦ C/6 h\\n≅ 10 µ m α -grains, 88% volume fraction\\n[47]\\nRRBB\\nhot forging + 190 ◦ C/6 h\\n≅ 10 µ m α -grains, 88% volume fraction\\n[48]\\nRRBB\\nhot forging + 190 ◦ C/6 h\\n≅ 10 µ m α -grains, 88% volume fraction\\n[49]\\nRRBB\\nhot forging + 190 ◦ C/6 h\\n≅ 10 µ m α -grains, 88% volume fraction\\n[50]\\nRRBB\\nn.a.\\n6 µ m α -grains*\\n[51]\\nA hot rolling + 800 ◦ C/\\n40 min\\n3 µ m α -grains* *\\n[52]\\nL\\na.c.: air cooling *tested by load-relaxation experiments\\n* * qualitative estimate obtained from the Figure presented in the sources\\nTable 6 Details of the alloy with Widmanstatten microstructure (the last column reports\\nthe acronyms used in the Figures).\\nthermomechanical treatment\\nquantitative notes on microstructure (laths)\\nsource\\nacronym\\n1100 ◦ C/1 h + air cooling\\nn.a.\\n[46]\\nN 1050 ◦ C/0.5 h/f.c.* to 700 ◦ C/a.c.\\n3.2 – 4.0 µ m\\n[56]\\nB\\n1050 ◦ C/0.5 h/f.c.\\nn.a.\\n[53]\\nAOS 1050 ◦ C/0.5 h/f.c.* to 700 ◦ C/a.c.\\n3.2 – 4.0 µ m\\n[54]\\nAOS\\n1050 ◦ C/0.5 h/f.c.* to 25 ◦ C\\nn.a.\\n[55]\\nAOS\\nn.a.\\n11 µ m\\n[62]\\nAOS\\na.c.: air cooling f.c. furnace cooling\\n* 6 ◦ C/min\\nS. Spigarelli et al.\\nAdditive Manufacturing 49 (2022) 102520\\n10\\nresult is self-evident. The first obvious example is the high strain rates\\nobtained by testing the equiaxed alloy at 700 ◦ C and, on a lesser scale, at\\n600 ◦ C. A second example is the above-mentioned dataset for the alloy\\nwith the Widmanstatten structure tested at 500 ◦ C and 600 ◦ C.\\nThe behaviour of the equiaxed material at 700 ◦ C was addressed\\nfirst. The Ti-6Al-4V alloy is well known for its superplastic behaviour at\\nhigh temperatures. In this regard, Alabort et al. [51] provided conclu-\\nsive insights into the mechanisms responsible for superplasticity. In\\nparticular, they concluded that Rachinger grain boundary sliding (GBS)\\nwas the dominant process producing the superplasticity of Ti6-Al-4V.\\nThe equilibrium subgrain size ( λ ) was a key factor, because when λ\\nwas greater than the mean grain size ( d ), the Rachinger GBS was rate\\ncontrolling and resulted in a superplastic behaviour [64]. When λ was\\nsmaller than d , dislocations formed subgrain boundaries, and classical\\nclimb-controlled deformation occurred. Alabort et al. calculated the\\nequilibrium subgrain size as follows:\\nλ = 35 bG σ\\n(11)\\nFig. 8a plots the calculated equilibrium grain size at 700 ◦ C as a function\\nof the applied stress. The condition λ > 10 µ m was obtained for applied\\nstresses below 25 MPa, with λ > 5 µ m for σ < 50 MPa. On these bases, in\\na fine-grained alloy, one could indeed expect the occurrence of extensive\\nGBS in a wide range of applied stresses, even at 700 ◦ C. At this tem-\\nperature, in the low-strain rate regime, for a fine-grained alloy, intra-\\ngranular deformation is reduced and GBS is active, although cavitation\\ndue to the low volume fraction of β - phase precludes attaining high\\nrupture strains [51].\\nAlabort et al. modelled the material response by an equation in the\\nfollowing form:\\n˙ ε = ˙ ε α (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) f β ) + ˙ ε β f β + ˙ ε gbs\\n(12)\\nwhere the suffixes α and β denote the strain rates and volume fractions of\\nthe two phases, respectively, and the last term is the strain rate due to\\nGBS. Below 700 ◦ C, the volume fraction of the β -phase ( f β ) is low, and,\\nfor the sake of simplicity, the overall contribution of this phase can be\\nneglected, as in previous sections, thus giving\\n˙ ε ≈ ˙ ε α + ˙ ε gbs\\n(13)\\nThe strain rate due to GBS can be calculated as indicated in [51]\\nusing the following equation:\\n˙ ε gbs =\\nA gbs f 0 . 44 β D 0 gbs b\\nkT\\n( b\\nd\\n) 2 ( σ\\nG\\n) 2 exp ( (cid:0) Q gbs\\nRT\\n)\\n(14)\\nwith Qgbs = 174 kJ mol (cid:0) 1 . The term A gbs D 0gbs was recalculated to obtain\\nthe same curves presented in [51], with the relevant values of the β -volume fraction. The curves presented in Fig. 9a were obtained by\\ncombining Eqs. (4), (12), and (14) for different values of the grain size\\nand f β = 0.12. This figure also reports the same data shown in Fig. 8c,\\nand additional results obtained under a constant strain rate at the same\\ntemperature (peak stress values at different testing ˙ ε ). A comparison\\nbetween the experimental data and the model curves clearly confirms\\nthat the deviation observed in Fig. 8c can be explained by the occurrence\\nof GBS. This is clearly the case for the fine-grained alloys tested in [51,\\n52], while the material investigated in [47 – 50] was said to exhibit a\\nlarger grain size (10 µ m). Thus, the experimental high strain rates were\\nstill somewhat higher than the model ones. On the other hand, the\\nanalysis of the micrograph reported in [49] suggested that, in the\\nconsidered material, a high fraction of the total population of α -grains\\nwas actually much finer than 10 µ m. A rough estimate of the grain size\\nusing the linear intercept method on the micrograph in [49] actually\\ngave an average grain size close to 5 µ m, a measurement that unfortu-\\nnately also takes into account the β -grains. If a large fraction of the α - grains have a size close to 5 – 8 µ m, which is realistic, the high strain\\nrate values observed in the low-stress region can easily be justified by\\nGBS.\\nFig. 9b plots the data for equiaxed, duplex, and lamellar micro-\\nstructures and the model curve for the duplex microstructure at two\\nlower temperatures, 500 and 600 ◦ C. The figure actually confirms that,\\nat 500 ◦ C, the data for the duplex and equiaxed alloy align on the model\\ncurve, with only two points significantly deviating from this trend. In\\naddition, in the case of the lamellar structure, several data substantially\\noverlap the curve, with the major exception being the often-mentioned\\nresults from [56]. At 600 ◦ C, the majority of the data obtained by testing\\nthe lamellar alloy superimpose with those for the duplex alloy. Never-\\ntheless, again the data from [56] substantially deviate from the model\\ncurve. In addition, at 600 ◦ C, in the low-stress regime , the equiaxed alloy\\nis somewhat softer than the duplex and lamellar ones. GBS was\\nconsidered as a possible cause for such a behaviour at 700 ◦ C. This\\nmechanism is usually considered irrelevant below 700 ◦ C [52,58,59],\\nbut superplasticity could indeed even occur at 600 ◦ C, provided that the\\nalloy has a sub-micron grain size [65]. This was not obviously the case\\nfor the alloys here analysed. Nevertheless, GBS could still occur, without\\nreaching a superplastic response due to early damage. In this regard, it is\\ninteresting to note that in [50] the rupture elongation under 97 MPa at\\n600 ◦ C was close to 53%, while under the rest of the experimental\\nconditions, it did not exceed 35% (in just one case) or was much lower.\\nIn order to verify the hypothesis that GBS might play a role at 600 ◦ C, the\\ncombination of Eqs. (4), (12), and (14), with two different grain sizes,\\nwas again used to obtain the last model curves presented in Fig. 9b. The\\ndescription is surprisingly accurate, which suggests that the occurrence\\nof extensive GBS should not a-priori be ruled out as a concrete possibility\\nto explain the acceleration of the creep rate in the equiaxed\\nmicrostructure.\\nYet, there is indeed a last point that deserves an additional comment:\\nthe scatter of the data for the lamellar structure. One can suppose that\\nthe increased strength of the alloy tested by Barboza et al. [56] was due\\nto the precipitation of Ti 3 Al particles in α -lamellae, which have been\\nreported to increase the material hardness [66]. This phenomenon could\\nbe caused by the supersaturation of Al that segregates in the α -phase.\\nThe particles may act as obstacles for dislocation motion, an effect that\\ncan be described by introducing a σ p term (threshold stress) into Eq. (9).\\nThe threshold stress approach was used by Barboza et al. to rationalise\\ntheir data. Nevertheless, no conclusions can be drawn, because there\\nwas no experimental evidence of the precipitation of a further\\nstrengthening phase in those samples, nor any other viable explanation\\nto justify the reason for the occurrence of this phenomenon only in the\\nexperiments in [56] and not in others carried out under analogous\\ntesting conditions [53,54].\\n4.6. Creep response of SLM-produced Ti-6Al-4V samples annealed under β -transus\\nSections 4.2 – 4.5 showed that the creep response of Ti-6Al-4 V with\\nthe α + β transformed microstructure could be described by essentially\\nthe same constitutive equations if the case was properly modified to\\nconsider the possible occurrence of GBS in equiaxed materials.\\nThe fast cooling of AM-manufactured Ti-6Al-4V results in the for-\\nmation of a non-equilibrium martensitic α ’ -phase. This phase only\\npartially transforms into the equilibrium α and β phases during\\nannealing [13]. The presence of residual amounts of the martensitic\\nphase, in principle, could affect the creep response, but prolonged\\nholding at high temperatures should progressively cause its complete\\nS. Spigarelli et al.\\nAdditive Manufacturing 49 (2022) 102520\\n11\\ndissolution. The experimental results above illustrated show that\\nmartensite transformation indeed continues during creep exposure,\\nalthough only for higher temperatures and longer durations the α ’ - phase\\ncompletely disappears. Thus, a moderate difference in the already low\\nfraction of α ’ - phase in the various tested samples should be observed in\\ncorrespondence of the minimum creep rate. On the other hand, if any\\neffect exists, it should be limited to the low-temperature regime, where\\nmartensite transformation is sluggish.\\nOn these bases, creep can again be assumed to be governed by the\\ndeformation of the α -phase, which in any case forms more of 90% of the\\ntotal microstructure. The columnar grain structure typical of the SLM\\nalloy is not compatible with the requirements (ultrafine equiaxed grains)\\nfor extensive GBS, so the same set of constitutive equations already\\nsuccessfully used for duplex alloys could be applied to the AM material.\\nThe only parameter that needed to be estimated is R max , which, in turn,\\ncould be approximated from the UTS using Eq. (6). With UTS = 1070 MPa, no other parameters were required to obtain a set of model\\ncurves, which are presented in Fig. 10a. The same figure also shows the\\nexperimental data obtained in the present study. The correlation with\\nthe model curves is excellent, with a significant deviation being\\nobserved only in the high stress/low temperature regime, where\\nmartensite could play a role. Again, the same set of constitutive equa-\\ntions provided an accurate prediction of the minimum creep rate\\ndependence on the applied stress for the material produced by AM,\\nwhich in principle should present significant differences with similar\\nmaterials produced by conventional technologies. Even more signifi-\\ncant, this straightforward procedure does not require any input, with the\\nexception of the UTS value at room temperature.\\nFig. 10b plots the model curves obtained at 500 and 600 ◦ C for the\\nAM annealed alloy and for the materials with bimodal (duplex) and\\nequiaxed (10 µ m grain size) microstructures discussed in the previous\\nsections. The curves for equiaxed and duplex microstructures substan-\\ntially overlap, except in the low-stress regime at high temperature, with\\nGBS operative in the former. In contrast, the ultrafine microstructure of\\nthe AM alloy results in a high UTS value that provides a small advantage\\nin the creep response. This improvement is progressively lost as the\\nstress decreases, because in the low-strain-rate regime the R max term\\nloses its relevance in determining the creep rate.\\nThe accuracy of the model in describing experimental data is even\\nsomewhat surprising, when one considers that the amount of α ’ -phase,\\nas mentioned above, changes in the different samples, due to martensite\\nprogressive transformation as time at high temperature increases. This\\nfact seems to imply that martensite does not behaves much differently\\nthan α -phase. In this context, it is indeed crucial to verify if the\\nmartensitic structure of the as-deposited material responds differently.\\nThe α ’ - martensite contains a high density of dislocations, and, at least\\nfor this reason, it could be expected to exhibit a higher creep resistance.\\nHowever, the scarce evidence available does not fully support this pic-\\nture. Fig. 11 shows a comparison between the experimental data ob-\\ntained by Viespoli et al. [10] by testing an alloy in the as-deposited state.\\nThe figure also plots the model curves again calculated with UTS = 1070 MPa (no information was available on the tensile strength of\\nthat specific material). The curves are thus the same as those obtained at\\nthe same temperatures for the annealed alloy, as shown in Fig. 10. A\\ncomparison between the curves and data suggests that the alloy in the\\nas-deposited structure behaves like the annealed one, or is even less\\ncreep resistant. On the basis of the very limited experimental evidence,\\nthe potential advantages, in terms of better creep response, of the\\nas-deposited martensitic structure over the annealed one can be seri-\\nously questioned. In addition, the Figure demonstrates that the creep\\nresponse of two alloys, one with fully martensitic structure and another\\npartially transformed after annealing, is almost equivalent. Thus, the\\ncreep response of α and α ’ phases is remarkably similar.\\nOn the other hand, the higher creep resistance of the AM Ti-6Al-4V,\\nwhen compared with samples produced by traditional technologies, has\\nbeen confirmed, at least in a well-defined range of temperatures and\\nFig. 10. a) Experimental values of the minimum creep rate for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by AM and annealed at 740 ◦ C for 2 h, and model curves.

Reconsidering consolidated opinions: role of initial microstructure on\\ncreep response of Ti-6Al-4V\\nThe traditional view is that the equiaxed microstructure is less creep-\\nresistant than the duplex and lamellar microstructures [3]. The previous\\nparagraphs suggested that this view is only partially supported by the\\nexperimental data, at least when they were available under a sufficiently\\nbroad range of experimental conditions. A single set of constitutive\\nequations can provide a good description of the minimum creep rate\\ndependence on the applied stress for Ti-6Al-4V, irrespective of the initial\\nmicrostructure, with the major exception being the effect of GBS on\\nequiaxed alloys. A potential exception is the possible role of precipita-\\ntion during creep exposure, which could be the cause of the lower creep\\nrates observed in few cases for lamellar structures. This is not equivalent\\nto saying that the initial microstructure is not important. On the con-\\ntrary, the previous thermo-mechanical history plays a decisive role,\\nbecause it determines the value of the UTS, which is the only data\\nrequired as an input to make the model work. Thus, parameters such as\\nthe grain size or the size of the lamellae in the basket-wave structure are\\nof paramount importance because they greatly affect the dislocation\\nmobility and, in the last instance, the value of the UTS. A higher UTS\\nyields a lower minimum creep rate under a given stress. On the other\\nhand, the effect of the UTS gradually becomes less important at high\\ntemperatures/low stresses (Fig. 10), i.e. in regimes where prolonged\\nholding at high temperatures is expected to cause a substantial recovery\\nof the initial structure. In this context, the behaviour of SLM Ti-6Al-4V\\ncould be better interpreted. SLM produces a highly heterogeneous\\nmicrostructure, with large amounts of α ’ - martensite. After\\nlow-temperature annealing, the UTS of the SLM products remains higher\\nthan similar materials processed by conventional technologies. Thus, a\\nsomewhat higher creep strength could be expected, at least at low\\ntemperatures and for short test durations (Fig. 10b). As temperature\\nand/or time of exposure increase, the SLM creep behaviour becomes\\nfully comparable with that of conventional products.\\nThe present paper could represent a further step towards the un-\\nderstanding of the creep response of AM-produced Ti-6Al-4V compo-\\nnents, observed in a wider context that accounts for materials produced\\nby traditional technologies. Under this regard, there is still other point\\nthat needs to be clarified. This point is the role of β -phase, which can be\\nthought to creep in parallel with α / α ’ . In all the cases here contemplated,\\nthe α -phase was present as the dominant constituent, with the β -phase\\nbeing present in different amounts. Yet, this difference in β -phase con-\\ntent does not seem to significantly influence the creep response. This\\nobservation leads to wonder what the real contribution of β -phase on\\ncreep response really is.\\nA second major point, which specifically concerns the material\\nproduced by AM that still needs to be addressed, is the heterogeneity of\\nthe microstructure. This heterogeneity could lead to a non-isotropic\\ncreep response, which deserves to be properly considered for future\\nstudies.\\n5. Conclusion\\nThe creep response of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy produced by AM was\\ninvestigated after annealing at 740 ◦ C for 2 h. To understand the\\npotential differences in the creep behaviours of the investigated material\\nand similar alloys produced by traditional technologies, a wide collec-\\ntion of recent literature results was analysed. The conclusions of this\\nstudy can be summarised as follows.\\n- The same constitutive model could successfully be used to describe\\nthe creep responses of alloys with equiaxed, duplex, and Wid-\\nmanst ¨ atten microstructures. This constitutive model only requires\\nthe UTS of the alloy at room temperature as the input data. The\\nvalidity of using the same equation for alloys with different micro-\\nstructures suggests that the creep is controlled by the dominant\\nconstituent, i.e. the α -phase, irrespective of its morphology.\\n- A significant deviation between the model predictions and experi-\\nmental data could be observed in the equiaxed alloy only at 600 and\\n700 ◦ C in the low-stress regime, the most probable cause being the\\noccurrence of GBS. Accordingly, once the model was modified to\\naccount for GBS, an excellent correlation between the prediction\\ncurve and data was obtained.\\n- The creep response of the alloy produced by AM and annealed at\\n740 ◦ C for 130 min could be described by the same constitutive\\nmodel without any modifications. This implied that the presence of α ’ -martensite did not lead to significant changes in the creep-\\ncontrolling mechanisms. Indeed, comparison of the data obtained\\nin the present study with the creep behaviour of an alloy in as-\\ndeposited state, with its resulting fully martensitic microstructure,\\nseems to suggest that both α and α ’ phases creep with similar rates\\nwhen tested in the same conditions;\\n- The fine microstructure and presence of martensite, which is typical\\nof materials produced by AM, resulted in high values for the room-\\ntemperature tensile strength, which was the only input used for the\\nmodel. The analysis suggested that Ti-6Al-4V, even after annealing,\\ndue to its high UTS, exhibits lower creep rates at a given stress at\\n500 ◦ C, in the high stress regime. For longer testing durations at\\n500 ◦ C, or at higher temperature, the material response is equivalent\\nto that of similar alloys produced by conventional technologies.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nS.
